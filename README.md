# üõ†Ô∏è Dotfiles

Welcome to my **dotfiles** repository. This repository contains the configuration files (dotfiles) I use to set up and customize my development environment. It helps ensure consistency across my systems and makes onboarding to a new machine seamless. I use  [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks for configuration management.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your preferred directory. For example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashouck/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

---

### **2. Install GNU Stow**
GNU Stow is used to symlink the dotfiles to your home directory.

- **On macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install stow
  ```

- **On Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install stow
  ```

---

### **3. Apply Configurations**
Use Stow to create symlinks for the desired configuration files. For example:
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow -t ~ vim zsh git tmux
```

This will create symlinks in your home directory (e.g., `~/.vimrc` ‚Üí `~/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc`).

---

### **4. Reload Your Shell**
After setting up, reload your shell to apply changes:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
